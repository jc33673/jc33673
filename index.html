	<li><h2>Introduce of a great storyteller</h2></li>
	<p>Hayao Miyazaki is a Japanese film director, producer, screenwriter. Through his career that he has spent five decades,</p> 
	<p>Miyazaki attained international reputation as a great story teller and director of anime films.</p>

	<li><h2>Hayao Miyazaki’s career</h2></li>
	<p>Miyazaki began this animation career in 1963 joining Toei animation. From there, Miyazaki worked as an artist for <span style=color:red><b>gulliver’s travel beyond the moon</b></span>’</p>
	<p>where he pitched ideas that eventually became the movie's ending. He continued to work in various roles in the animation industry until he directed his first feature film, <span style=color:red><b>Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro</b></span>, released in 1979.</p>
	<p>After the success of his next film, <span style=color:red><b>Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</b></span> (1984), he co-founded Studio Ghibli, where he continued to produce many feature films. </p>
	<p>While Miyazaki's films have long enjoyed both commercial and critical success in Japan, he remained largely unknown to the West until Miramax Films released <span style=color:red><b>Princess Mononoke</b></span> (1997).</p>
	<p><span style=color:red><b>Princess Mononoke</b></span> was briefly the highest-grossing film in Japan and it became the first animated film to win Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards.</p>

	<li><h2>Hayao Miyazaki’s style of directing</h2></li>
	<p>Most of the Miyazaki’s films contain the same themes like relationship with human, nature and techology and themes about war(usually anti war).</p>
	<p>For example, his early two films in Ghibli 'Castle in the sky' and 'nausicaa' involve the message about nature destryed by human. 'Howl’s moving castle' and’the wind rises’ implies the anit war.</P>
	<p>He is the best animation director who carries the message about human being. Miyazaki always show bright image and fantasies world to audience dealing with heave message in his films.</P>
